An example project with [unity-empty-project-template](https://github.com/vangogih/unity-empty-project-template) structure.

This is a real test assignment from DataSakura company.

## Description

Prototype three-dimensional game, amphibious airplane combat.

Camera view from behind our airplane, control the airplane with a joystick left-right, up-down. The airplane flies forward automatically.

There is water below the airplane (just a blue plane). If the plane flies below the water, its speed becomes 2 times slower.

There is a fire button, when you press it, a bullet comes out and flies forward.

There is also an enemy plane, which flies according to a primitive algorithm: it changes course in the direction of our plane, and at a distance less than N starts shooting at us. At the same time its speed is less than ours by X percent.

When hitting any airplane, the game starts over.
